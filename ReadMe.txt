As matlab does not have a supported built in function for importing data from yahoo finance I had to use python within matlab to import a package called 'yfinance'
The steps for downloading the package are as follows

- Call the pyenev function within matlab to ensure you have python installed and ready to go. Note : the python version must be supported in matlab so make sure you have python version 3.10 installed
- Download the dependencies in your console (CMD) with either 'pip install y finance' if pip is in your PATH environment variable otherwise use 'python -m pip install yfinance' if its not
- Now you should be ready to run my code!


Additional Notes:
- Comments are provided on how to use the code, it is also quite intuitve.
